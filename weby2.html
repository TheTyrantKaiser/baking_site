	<h1></strong>How to make a chocolate lava cake</strong></h1>
	<h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips</li>
		<li>10 tablespoons of salted butter (or unsalted)</li>
		<li>1/8 teaspoon of salt (for unsalted butter 1/4 teaspoon, and 1/16 teaspoon)</li>
		<li>1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
		<li>3 large eggs</li>
		<li>1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar</li>
		<li>1/2 cup of all purpose flour</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2><strong>Instructions</strong></h2>
	<ol>
		<li>preheat the oven to 400 degrees F</li>
		<li>Grease the bottom, and sides of your ramekins or souffle cups</li>
		<li>In a medium bowl, add the chocolate, and butter. Melt in a saucepan, until smooth.</li>
		<li>Off the heat add in the salt, and vanilla, then allow the mixture to cool until room temperature (insure it isn't hot, warm is fine).</li>
		<li>In a large bowl with either handheld mixer or a whisk, beat the eggs until thick, and light in color (approx 2-3 minutes).</li>
		<li>Add the powdered sugar to the eggs, and mix until combined. Add the (now) cooled melted chocolate mixture, add the flour, and mix with a spoon (avoid overmixing).</li>
		<li>Pour an amount you deem reasonable in the ramekin (or souffle cup)</li>
		<li>Bake for 18 minutes at 400 degrees F</li>
		<li>When it's finished baking. Allow it to rest for 2-3 minutes.</li>
		<p>To check if done correctly, get a toothpick, insert the tooth pick to the outer side of the cake, if the toothpick comes out dry then that's good.
		Then insert the toothpick to the middle of the lava cake, if the toothpick comes out wet (covered in chocolate). Then you've made the chocolate lava cake correctly.</p>
		<p>However if the toothpick comes out dry when inserted on the middle, and the sides then it's overcooked. If the toothpick is wet on the sides, and middle, then it's undercooked.</p>
	</ol>
	
	<h2><strong>Serving</strong></h2>
	<p>To not serve either yourself (unless if you want too) or someone else an entire ramekin (or souffle cup), you can get a plate, place the top part of the plate onto the top of the cake, Then flip it, and allow the cake too
	come out onto the plate. If the cake hasn't fallen out you can get a knife, and insert the knife, and cut around the edge of the cake to allow it fall out much easily.</p>
