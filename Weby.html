	<h1><strong>The dessert that alters your mood, and mind</strong></h1>
	<p>You may wonder why I call the Bitter & Blanc a dessert that alters your mood, and mind. 
	It's due to the amazing flavour, and taste you obtain from eating it once.
	One taste alone from this dessert, and it'll leave you happier, and thinking more positive thoughts once you've had the dessert.
	Not only that but whomever you share the dessert with or if you eat it yourself. It'll leave that person wanting more. That's just how good the dessert is.

	<h3><strong>How to make a Brioche Bread</strong></h3>
	<p><strong>The Ingredients</strong></p>
	<ul>
	<li>1/2 cup of warm milk</li>
	<li>1 packet of instant dry yeast or 2 1/2 tsp</li>
	<li>1/4 cup of granulated sugar (divided)</li>
	<li>6 tbsp of unsalted butter</li>
	<li>2 eggs room temp</li>
	<li>2 1/2 cups of all purpose flour</li>
	</ul>

	<ol>
	<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
	<li>In a mixing bowl, combine 1/2 cup of warm milk, 1 packet (2 1/2 tsp) of instant dry yeast, and 1 tbsp of granulated sugar (remove 1 tbsp from the  1/4 cup of sugar). Let the mixture sit until the yeast becomes active, and foamy</li>
	<li>Add in the rest of the sugar, 6 tbsps of butter, and 2 eggs. Then whisk until everything comes together. If you're using a stand mixer then whisk on medium high speed.</li>
	<li>Add 2 cups of flour, and 1 tsp of salt into the bowl. Use a fork (or switch out the whisk for a dough hook if using a stand mixer), mix (at low speed with dough hook) until the flour is fully incorporated. 
	You can determine if you need more flour at this point, but when you're done the right consistency should pull clean from the mixer, it shouldn't be too stiff, and slightly sticky.</li>
	<li>Then increase the speed to a medium high speed, and mix for an additional 3-4 mintues (if you don't have a mixer with a dough hook then continue to mix for 15 minutes or more).</li>
	<li>Remove the dough from the mixer, and place it into a oiled bowl (or utilise the same bowl), cover it with plastic wrap, and keep it covered for about an hour until the dough doubles in size.</li>
	<li>Once the dough has doubled in size, fold it by tipping the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and pound the air out of it. Roll it back into a ball, and place it into your bowl, cover, and let it rest for another 30-45 minutes.
	It should up again, and be airy but not quite double in size.</li>
	<li>Prepare a loaf pan (it can be the aluminum version) by spraying it with nonstick baking spray, and set aside</li>
	<li>When your dough is ready tip it out onto a lightly floured surface again, and pat flat. Cut the dough into 3 equal pieces, and roll it out to about 12 inches (or approximately 9 if that's the size of your loaf pan). 
	Then lay each strand of dough side by side, and join the top together by lightly rolling them into a point.
	Braid the strands all the way down and at the bottom pinch, and roll the ends together.</li>
	<li>Tuck the pointed ends under the loaf, and fit the loaf into the prepareed pan. Cover (with plastic wrap) and let rest for about 30-45 minutes. Until the dough has risen slightly above the top of the pan.</li>
	<li>While the loaf is proofing, preheat your oven to 325 degrees F (165 C)</li>
	<li>Once your loaf is proofed, and ready, uncover and brush with your egg wash (1 egg, and water). Bake for 30-45 minutes. The loaf will be golden brown, and a thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf should read 190 degrees F.</li>
